# To start/build project:

## With Make

1. Make sure you have golang (using v.1.15) and npm installed
2. in root directory, run: make start
3. Hopefully make works on windows too if you are running that.
4. With this way frontend will be served on port 5000

*Obligatory works on my computer*

## If the above doesnt work:

1. In frontend directory run: npm start
2. In backend directory run either:
    1. go run
    2. go build && ./backend
3. With this way frontend will be served on port 3000
